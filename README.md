# RealShare — Minimal Landing (Vite + React + Tailwind)

A minimal starter with a single-file landing page component (`src/App.jsx`) implementing an Apple-style, white SaaS landing page. It uses Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion for subtle animations.

## Quick start (macOS / zsh)

Install dependencies and run the dev server:

```bash
# from project root
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite (normally http://localhost:5173).

## Notes
- The main component is `src/App.jsx` — it's a single-file landing page as requested.
- Replace the placeholder email handler in `src/App.jsx` with your backend integration.
- Tailwind is already configured (see `tailwind.config.cjs`).
- Framer Motion is installed as a dependency; tweak animations in `src/App.jsx`.
